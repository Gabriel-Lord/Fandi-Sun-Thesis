MATLAB codes for 
    1. Adaptive Milstein method ('AdaptiveMilstein') and   
    2. Adaptive Milstein method with Jump process ('JumpAdaptedAdaptiveMilstein'). 
    
Both methods are tested on 1D and 2D models. 

The main script for generating the convergence and efficiency plots are under the 
'1D' and '2D' folders under each method. 

There are other testing models and plots that can be generated via scripts 
named as 'mainXXX.m'.

To run the main scripts, please download the whole folder under either method
e.g. '1D' or '2D', because MATLAB requires the defined functions to be saved 
under the same path.
